# Bird Sanctuary

## Getting Started

- Fork this repo
- Clone the forked repository
- `cd` to the directory where you cloned it
- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `npm run cypress` to open the cypress testing window

> _Note_: Remember to `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` regularly

## Submission Guidelines

- When finished, commit and push your work.
- Make a pull request on Github.
- Submit the link to your pull request on Canvas.

This challenge is designed to assess the React skills you have gained so far.

You will be graded based on the number of completed, functioning User Stories (see below).

**You will not be graded on CSS. It is not required in this project**

## Assessment Details

Create a bird sanctuary donation app that meets the user stories below.

The birds are in the array in `src/data/birds.js` and the bonus items are in `src/data/bonusItems.js`. Import these in your `App.js` component and pass them to your child components as needed. **Use these items and do not change any information in the array, or else the tests will fail.**

The following demo has been styled for clarity.
**You do not need to style this app.**

Here is a deployed version of the application. Use it to feel and notice the functionality of the application:&nbsp;

**CSS is not required and you willl not be given points for CSS**.
Here is a video of what your app could look like with no CSS:&nbsp;

1. I can see a series of bonuses based on the number of items I have in my cart (10pts)
1. I can use a checkout form with a first name, last name, email and zip code to submit my purchase (10pts)
1. I can see an alert for successful purchase when I submit a purchase (5pts)
1. I can see my cart fully reset when I submit my purchase from my form (10pts)
1. I can delete a bird from my cart (10pts)

## Acceptance criteria and tests

The acceptance criteria below are covered by unit tests. Notice that there are some important details about the exact text, classes, or HTML tags you'll need to use in order to pass the tests.

Your React app should be made up of a minimum of 3 components:

- Cards.js
- Checkout.js
- Cart.js

### Cards.js (Bird cards)

The bird data comes from `src/data/birds.js` and should be imported into App.js and passed to the proper children.

- Each bird card displays the name, image, and amount (price)
- Each bird card has a class name of `birds`
- Each bird card has an `Adopt` button
  - The button text should be: `Adopt`

### Cart.js

- The cart has a class name of `Cart`
- When I click on a bird card's adopt button from `Cards.js`, its name appears in the Cart.js `<ol>` as a list item.
- The total shows up as an `<h4>` element inside the cart
- When I click on an additional item, the total cost is updated and additional bird name(s) is added as a list item to the unordered list
- When I click on the same bird more than once, nothing happens after the first time
- When there are less than 3 birds in the cart there is a 0% discount
- When there are 3 or more birds in the cart there is a 10% discount which is listed in the Cart
- When there is a 10% discount, it is reflected in the price
- When my total is of the appropriate amount, I will receive bonuses that will be listed in the Cart

#### Cart Bonuses Section

The bonuses come from `src/data/bonusItems.js` and should be imported into App.js and passed to the proper children.

- The bonus items are added as list items in an `<ul>` list item as follows:
- 1 bonus (first array item) is given if the total is at least 100 and no more than 299
- 2 bonuses (first and second array items) are given if the total is at least 300 and no more than 499
- 3 bonuses are given if the total is at least 500 and no more than 1000
- 4 bonuses are given if the total is 1000 or more

### Checkout.js

- The Checkout component has a class name of `Checkout`
- I can complete the inputs in the checkout form for first name, last name, email, and zip code
- When I complete the form with valid inputs and click `Submit`, an alert tells me: `You have adopted birds. Thank you!`
- When I close the alert box, the cart component fully resets (no birds, no discount, total = 0, no bonus items listed)

## Help and tips

- Before you write any code, think about your component structure.

  - What components will you need to represent the parts of the app?
  - Which components will need to have state?
  - Which components will need to know about the state of **other components**?
  - Which components will need to get props (data or callbacks) from another component?
  - Which components will be rendered by other components?
  - Draw out your component structure. Check your drawing against the user stories. Will you be able to implement all of the stories with this structure?

- If your tests are failing, read the acceptance criteria closely. Some tests expect you to use specific text, classes, or HTML elements.

## Academic Integrity

- Do this assessment **on your own**.
  - Do not pair program with other fellows.
  - Do not refer to work from other fellows.
  - Do not ask individuals outside the program for help.
- You can refer to any notes that you have.
- You can Google anything you want, but do not copy any code that you do not understand.
- Your instructors are here to help you with technical difficulties.
  - Make sure that the tests are running on your computer. If not, tell an instructor ASAP.
  - Make sure that you can fork and clone the repo and run the app. If not, tell an instructor ASAP.
